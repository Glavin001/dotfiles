Dotfiles
========

The dotfiles of Glavin Wiechert. Forked from Dawson Reid's dotfiles.

## Installation
Run the following command in your Terminal.
Pre-requisits: Make sure that you do not already have any dotfiles installed a `$HOME/.vimrc`, as this will clone the repo and setup a symlink to that path.
#### 1) Clone via SSH:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Glavin001/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./install
```
#### 2) Clone via HTTP:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Glavin001/dotfiles.git && dotfiles && ./install
```
