Dotfiles
========

The dotfiles of Glavin Wiechert. Forked from Dawson Reid's dotfiles.

## Installation
Run the following command in your Terminal.
Pre-requisits: Make sure that you do not already have any dotfiles installed, as this will clone the repo and setup a symlink.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Glavin001/dotfiles.git && ./install
```

## Dawson Reid's original dotfiles
I have likely not changed much: https://github.com/dreid93/dotfiles
